## **Post-Hackathon Considerations**

This Phase 1 prototype will serve as the foundation for:
- **Phase 2:** Production heuristics engine development
- **Phase 3:** Microservice architecture and ML integration
- **Leadership Buy-in:** Demonstration of business value and technical feasibility
- **User Testing:** Validation of UX assumptions with real merchants

The prototype should be built with clean, maintainable code that can inform the production architecture while maximizing visual impact and user experience for stakeholder demonstration.
