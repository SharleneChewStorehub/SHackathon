**Started:** January 15, 2024  
**Last Updated:** July 9, 2025  
**Current Status:** Phase 1F Partially Complete - MULTIPLE CRITICAL FR GAPS IDENTIFIED  
**Next Session Goal:** Resolve Save & Next Button + Implement Missing FR Requirements  
**Overall Progress:** 68% complete (5.4/8 phases) - **MAJOR FR REQUIREMENTS MISSING**

---

## **📋 Project Overview**
Building a high-fidelity prototype that transforms static merchant dashboards into proactive, AI-powered growth consultants. Focus on demonstrating complete user workflow from insight discovery to campaign execution.

**Current Merchant:** Mama Kopitiam (Alia) - Malaysian F&B business  
**Current Branding:** Authentic StoreHub black (#1A1A1A) and orange (#FF6B35) color scheme  
**Current Status:** Phase 1F - Critical Save & Next Button Issue Blocking Demo Readiness

---

## **🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES**

### **🔴 URGENT: Save & Next Button Non-Functional**
**Issue:** Save & Next button in campaign setup pages does not work despite multiple fix attempts  
**Impact:** Blocks complete campaign launch workflow, preventing demo completion  
**Status:** UNRESOLVED - Multiple implementation attempts failed  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Required for demo functionality

#### **Fix Attempts Made:**
1. **CSS Selector Fix** - Changed `.campaign-setup-container` to `.engage-campaign-setup`
2. **Document Delegation** - Implemented document-level click handlers
3. **Direct Button Selection** - Used `querySelectorAll('.btn-primary')` with timeout
4. **Event Listener Debugging** - Added comprehensive logging and button detection
5. **SMS Validation Removal** - Simplified workflow by removing validation blocks

#### **Current Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Event listeners are being attached (confirmed via console logs)
- ✅ Button detection is working (buttons found and logged)
- ❌ Click events are not triggering `confirmEngageCampaignLaunch`
- ❌ Campaign launch workflow remains incomplete

### **🔴 MAJOR GAP: FR-4 Insight-to-Action Workflow Incomplete**
**Issue:** Critical FR-4 requirements not implemented according to PRD specifications  
**Impact:** Campaign workflow does not meet PRD requirements for Smart Segments and pre-filled campaigns  
**Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - Major gaps in core functionality  
**Priority:** HIGH - Required for authentic campaign workflow

#### **FR-4 Implementation Gaps:**
- ✅ **FR-4.1**: Basic routing to Engage module implemented
- ❌ **FR-4.2**: AI-Powered Smart Segments NOT implemented - no dynamic rule-based definitions
- ❌ **FR-4.3**: Pre-filled campaign details NOT properly implemented - forms are generic, not opportunity-specific

#### **What's Missing:**
- **Smart Segments**: No dynamic customer segmentation based on rules (e.g., `Lifetime Spend > X AND Last Visit > Y days`)
- **Pre-filled Forms**: Campaign setup forms are not pre-populated with opportunity-specific data
- **Audience Selection**: No "AI-Powered Smart Segment" selection in campaign setup
- **SMS Copy**: No opportunity-specific suggested SMS content generation

### **🔴 MAJOR GAP: FR-5 Feedback Loop Incomplete**
**Issue:** FR-5 requirements only partially implemented according to PRD specifications  
**Impact:** Card lifecycle does not follow complete PRD workflow  
**Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - Missing automatic card removal  
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Required for complete user experience

#### **FR-5 Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **FR-5.1**: Cards gray out immediately when Launch Campaign clicked
- ✅ **FR-5.2**: Cards show "✅ Campaign Launched! [View Performance]" status
- ❌ **FR-5.3**: Cards are NOT automatically removed after 24 hours and moved to Growth History

### **🔴 MAJOR GAP: FR-6 Growth History Incomplete**
**Issue:** Growth History page missing critical PRD requirements  
**Impact:** Does not provide authentic "CEO Report Card" functionality as specified  
**Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - Missing key drill-down features  
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Required for complete historical tracking

#### **FR-6 Implementation Gaps:**
- ✅ **FR-6.1**: Growth History page created and accessible
- ✅ **FR-6.2**: CEO Report Card vision partially implemented
- ✅ **FR-6.3**: "Potential vs. Actual" results comparison implemented
- ✅ **FR-6.4**: Success Score visual indicators implemented
- ❌ **FR-6.5**: Smart drill-down links NOT properly implemented
  - Missing "View Campaign Insights" links to actual Engage module reports
  - Missing "View Original Analysis" links to read-only justification modals
